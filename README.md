## What Is the SmartHouse Blocklist?

- **Purpose:**  
  Blocks domains used for telemetry, analytics, and tracking by smart home products and appliances (Amazon Echo, Google Home, smart TVs, cameras, etc.).

- **Focus:**  
  Stops excessive data collection and advertising while preserving device operation and functionality wherever possible.

- **Compatibility:**  
  Designed for [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html), [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), and any DNS-based filtering system that supports ABP/uBlock/AdGuard blocklists, including **uBlock Origin**, **Adblock Plus**, **AdGuard Browser Extension**, **NextDNS**, **Technitium DNS Server**, and **Control D**.

> **ABP/uBlock syntax used:** All rules use `||domain.com^` for maximum compatibility and avoid cosmetic or advanced scriptlet filtering.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: My device stopped working or lost a feature!**  
A: Some smart device features depend on telemetry or cloud calls. Check blocklist comments to find the likely domain, temporarily whitelist it, and report to help improve the list.

**Q: Is this blocklist safe for all IoT/TV brands?**  
A: The list targets known tracking/ad domains while avoiding those needed for core functions, but whitelisting may be needed; report issues.

**Q: How do I force an update?**  
A: Each platform has an ‚Äúupdate,‚Äù ‚Äúrefresh,‚Äù or ‚Äúreload blocklists‚Äù option; refer to documentation.

**Q: Can I use this with CleanBrowsing DNS or Ghostery?**  
A: No, they do not support ABP/uBlock/AdGuard list formats.

**Q: How often is this blocklist updated?**  
A: The list is updated **as needed or when new domains are discovered/reported**.
